# HTML Playground

This repository is a personal sandbox for testing and experimenting with various HTML concepts as I learn front-end development. 

## Purpose

The `html-playground` folder is where I:
- Practice new HTML elements and semantics.
- Test small front-end ideas and snippets.
- Explore concepts I learn during my coding journey.
- Revisit and reinforce HTML skills even after completing my initial learning phase.

## Notes

This is a learning-focused space, so the files here may not follow production-level standards. Instead, they reflect my learning process and growth over time.
